# Extending Existing Services and Project with SCITT

The IETF SCITT standards are designed to extend existing projects, products and services with a standards based way to push, discover, pull supply chain claims and evidence.

## Adding SCITT APIs

SCITT provides a set of API for pushing, discovering and pulling supply chain claims and evidence. 

By extending existing projects, products and services with SCITT apis, the users of the existing projects will add value to their services without having to configure yet another service, or configure yet more firewall rules.
