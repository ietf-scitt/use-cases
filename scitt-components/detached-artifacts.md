> TODO: Describe the importance for detached signatures, claims and evidence

- Protection from Trojan Horse Scenarios
- Ability to continually add information to sealed artifacts and evidence
- Ability to filter what may/should be promoted across an ecosystem
- Ability to link to existing artifacts by unique IDs and hashes (NOTE: to track how we'll establish unique IDs and/or hashes)
